Unfuddle-to-PivotalTracker Bridge
=================================

Helps to connect an Unfuddle git repository with Pivotal Tracker stories by
automatically adding a note to a Story whenever a relevant commit is made. The
note contains the commit revision and summary.

Configure default settings in bridge_config.yml (see bridge_config.yml.sample),
or just pass them directly when creating a new bridge object.

There is an example sinatra endpoint for the Unfuddle callback in endpoint.rb.
You need to configure the callback URL in the Unfuddle Repository settings.

Notes are attached to Stories when the Unfuddle commit message contains the
string "Story:12345". Functionality is similar to how Unfuddle auto-associates
changesets to tickets if the commit starts with '#12345'

The api_responses directory contains some examples of data from Unfuddle and
Pivotal.
